# evilcorp-api

This api is inspired by the TV series, 'Mr. Robot'.

The Front End has yet to be determined. In fact, I just may create an Angular, React and a Svelte front end projects.

It has a 1000 fake users in a MongoDB instance.

## Features to add as the project grows.

- [ ] Add authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Use validators in the middleware.
- [ ] Create an admin route with different roles that can assign roles to other 'EvilCorp employees'.
